# Think Inside the Box

A Firefox extension that recreates the defunct `<think>` wrapper functionality on JanitorAI chat pages.

## Overview

JanitorAI previously had a feature that automatically wrapped AI thinking blocks in collapsible, styled containers. This extension restores that functionality with enhanced customization options, allowing users to view thinking processes in organized, scrollable boxes.

## Features

- **Automatic Detection**: Identifies and wraps `<think></think>` blocks in real-time
- **Multiple Themes**: Choose from Default (dark purple), Dark, Minimal, or Custom themes
- **Customizable Styling**: Adjust height, font size, colors, and typography
- **Scroll Position Preservation**: Maintains your reading position when blocks are processed
- **React Virtuoso Compatible**: Works seamlessly with JanitorAI's virtual scrolling
- **Live Preview**: See styling changes instantly in the settings panel
